class XMLAdapter:
    """
    Helps incompatible componentes work together. Use this when integrating existing
    code, legacy systems, or libraries having different interfaces in your pipeline.

    Problem: Incompatible componentes within your pipeline make integration difficult
            (e.g., file formats, database systems, legacy code).
    
    Solution: The Adapter pattern acts as a translator, allowing incompatible
            components to work together.
    
    Impact and Benefits:
        - Increased Reusability: Existing componentes become usable in new contexts 
        without substantial changes.
        - Reduced Refactoring: You can adapt new or external components without 
        rewriting core pipeline logic.
