# Coding Data Pipeline Design Patterns in Python

## What are Coding Design Patterns?
Coding design patterns are general, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems 
within a given context in software design. They are not finished designs that can 
directly transformed into code; instead, they serve as templates or descriptions for 
how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns 
are considered formalized best practices that programmers can use to address frequent 
issues in software development.

Design patterns are categorized into several types, each serving a different purpose:

1. **Creational Patterns**: These deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to 
   create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object 
   creation could result in design problems or add complexity to the design. 
   Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this 
   object creation.
2. **Structural Patterns**: These concern class and object composition. They help 
   ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system 
   does not need to do the same. Moreover, they also assist in making sure that the 
   system is robust.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: These are concerned with algorithms and the assignment 
   of resposabilities between objects. They help make sure that the objects are 
   interacting in a smart way, without being too tightly coupled.

Design patterns are language-independent strategies for solving common design problems. 
They encapsulate successful design practices and provide a set of proven solutions to 
design challenges, promoting best practices in software design. They are not mandatory 
to implement in every project, but using them can make code more flexible, reusable, 
and maintainable.

## Benefits of Using Design Patterns

- **Solves Common Problems**: Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems 
  faced in software design. They have been evolved and refined over many years of 
  experience and collective knowledge.
- **Improves Code Reusability**: By using design patterns, developers can follow a 
  standard approach to solve a problem. This standardization makes the code more 
  reusable and easier to understand for new developers.
- **Facilitates Communication**: Design patterns provide a common vocabulary for 
  developers. When a developer says they are using a Singleton or Observer pattern, 
  others can quickly understand the design choice.
- **Increases Efficiency**: Applying design patterns can help to prevent issues that 
  may cause major problems, and it also helps in solving comples design issues more 
  efficiently.
- **Enhances Flexibility and Scalability**: Many design patterns, such as the Strategy 
  or State patterns, allow software to be more flexible in terms of behavior and more 
  scalable with minimal changes to the system.

## When to Choose Which Pattern
The best design pattern depends on your pipeline's specific needs:

- **Complexity**: For complex pipelines, *[Facade](core_structural_patterns/facade.py)* helps simplify interactions. 
*[Iterators](pipeline_specific_patterns/iterator.py)* or *[Chain of Responsability](pipeline_specific_patterns/chain_of_responsability.py)* increase modularity.
- **Flexibility**: *[Adapters](core_structural_patterns/adapter.py)* make your pipeline work with varied data sources. 
*[Strategies](pipeline_specific_patterns/strategy.py)* and the *[Factory](pipeline_specific_patterns/factory.py)* pattern support choosing algorithms or 
creating components dynamically.
- **Extensibility**: *[Decorators](core_structural_patterns/adapter.py)* enhance steps without major code changes. 
The *[Observer](behavioral_patterns/observer.py)* pattern syncs up dependent pipeline components.
- **Maintainability**: The *[Template Method](behavioral_patterns/template_method.py)* provides well-structured pipelines, 
and *[Command](behavioral_patterns/command.py)* helps isolate pipeline actions.

### Important Cosiderations

- **Don't Over-Engineer**: Simple pipelines rarely need many patterns. Start simple and 
refactor as complexity grows.
- **Combine Patterns**: Several of these patterns work well together within a pipeline design.

It's common for a complex data pipeline to incorporate multiple design patterns working 
together to address different aspects of its structure and behavior. Let's imagine a typical 
scenario to see how this might work:

### Scenario:
A data pipeline that needs to:

- Pull data from various sources (APIs, databases, cloud storage)
- Apply different cleaning and transformation strategies based on data source
- Log each step's details
- Handle errors gracefully
- Load the data into a data warehouse

## Possible Design Pattern Combination:

1. **[Facade](core_structural_patterns/facade.py)**: Interface simplifying the interaction with various data sources.
2. **[Adapters](core_structural_patterns/adapter.py)**: Handle the differing interfaces of sources as needed.
3. **[Strategy](pipeline_specific_patterns/strategy.py)**: Encapsulates different cleaning/transformation strategies, selectable at runtime.
4. **[Decorator](core_structural_patterns/adapter.py)**: Dynamiccalyy adds logging to processing steps.
5. **[Observer](behavioral_patterns/observer.py)**: Components notify a central error handler.
6. **[Command](behavioral_patterns/command.py)**: Load steps are encapsulated as commands, enabling retries and logging.

### How It Fits Together

- The Facade presents a unified way to extract data, hiding the complexity of diverse sources.
- Adapters allow integration of sources with incompatible interfaces.
- The Strategy pattern chooses the right cleaning/transformation approach based on source characteristics.
- Decorators inject logging without modifying the core processing logic.
- Observers coodinate error handling.
- Commands ensure load operations are trackable and repeatable.
