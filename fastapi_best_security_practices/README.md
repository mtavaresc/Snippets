# FastAPI Best Security Practices

## What's FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with 
Python 3.7+ based on standard Python-type hints. The key features are:

- **Speed**: It's on par with NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Ease of Use**: It offers automatic interactive API documentation.
- **Robustness**: Type checks and data validation out of the box.


## Security First: The Golden Rule
In the cybersecurity realm, prevention is bettern than cure. Here's how you can bake 
security right into your FastAPI applications:

1. **Authentication: Who are you?**
[Authentication](authentication.py) is the act of verifying who a user is. FastAPI 
provides several tools to aid in this process, but OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), 
Bearer with JWT tokens, is often a go-to choice.

2. **Authorization: What are you allowed to do?**
Once we know who the user is, we need to determine what they can do. 
[Role-based access control (RBAC)](authorization.py) is a common approach where users 
are assigned roles and each role is granted specific permissions.

3. **Data Validation: Garbage in, Garbage out**
FastAPI's use of [Pydantic](data_validation.py) models ensures that your data is valid 
before it even hits your application logic. Define your data models carefully and let 
Pydantic do the heavy lifting.

4. **SQL Injection Protection: Keep the Hackers at Bay**
FastAPI doesn't directly handle database transactions, but you can use ORMs like 
SQLAlchemy, which automatically protect you from [SQL Injection](sql_injection.py).

5. **HTTPS All the Way: Encrypting Data in Transit**
Always use HTTPS to encrypt data between your client and server. This is critical for 
protecting sensitive data like authentication tokens.

6. **Dependencies and Environment Management**
Keep yout dependencies updated and manage your envionment variables securely. 
Tools like `pipenv` or `poetry` can help in managing dependencies, and for environment 
variables, consider using `python-decouple` or `pydantic's BaseSettings`.

## Best Practices Beyond Code

- Regular Audits: Conduct code and dependency audits regularly.
- Logging and Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging and use tools like *Sentry* 
  for real-time monitoring and error reporting.
- Testing: Write tests for yout security flows. FastAPI makes it easy to test your 
  application.

FastAPI provides the tools need to build secure APIs, but it's the implementation that 
counts. Keep security at the forefront throughout the development lifecycle. 
By following best practices in authentication, authorations, data validation, and 
beyond, you'll be well on yout way to crafting robust and secure FastAPI applications. 
Remember, in the world of cybersecurity, there's no such thing as being too careful!
